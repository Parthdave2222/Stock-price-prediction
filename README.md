# Stock-price-prediction
Developed a stock price prediction model using Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and ANN by applying time-series preprocessing on historical data. The models were evaluated using MSE and RÂ² score, with results visualized to compare predicted and actual stock prices. This project enhanced my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, and financial data analysis.
